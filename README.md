# password-gen

## Concept 
For this project, we are given a start code and asked to make the program that would allow it to run. 
Within the starter code, we are already given the outline of the website, now I was asked to make the 
function of the website. The first thing that I did was make variables that would take in the user input
and make sure it fit the criteria. Once I had that complete, I went onto making the backbone of the generator.
In doing so, I listed out all the possible characters for each out (special, number, upper and lower case) and 
put that into a random generator where the computer can randomly choose the place and number being used. But 
before those numbers could be used, if the user "cancel" and said no to the specific schedule, then the output 
turn false and nothing will be processed for that character. The value is then stored into a variable where it 
will then be visable after pressing "Generate Password".

## Product
Below is the image of what I was able to created from the code.

## Problems
Some problems that I had with this code was trying to figure out how I wanted to continue a loop from what
we have learned in class. So I used "do while()" as a method to continue my loop as long as what was inputed
was false. Another thing that I had difficult with was trying to continue the loop with the code, like once I 
pressed on the button then how can I continue the loop and generate a new password.
